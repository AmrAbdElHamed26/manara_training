# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely-used graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It's particularly useful in scenarios like finding the shortest route in a road network or determining the optimal path in network routing.

## Introduction to Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm aims to find the shortest path in a weighted graph while ensuring that the sum of edge weights from the source node to any other node is minimized. It's an essential algorithm in various applications like route planning, network optimization, and more.

## Applications of Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is applied in numerous domains, including:

- Route Planning: Finding the shortest route between two locations on a map.
- Network Routing: Optimizing data packet routing in computer networks.
- Transportation: Determining optimal flight paths for airlines.
- Game Development: Implementing pathfinding in video games.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm Steps

Dijkstra's algorithm operates with the following steps:

1. Initialize the distance to the source node as 0 and all other distances as infinity.
2. Create a priority queue to manage nodes to visit based on their tentative distances.
3. Add the source node to the priority queue with a distance of 0.
4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:
    a. Dequeue the node with the smallest tentative distance.
    b. Explore its neighbors and update their distances if a shorter path is found.
    c. Enqueue unvisited neighbors with updated distances.
5. Repeat step 4 until all nodes have been visited.
