# Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that is used to efficiently keep track of a partition of a finite set into disjoint subsets. DSU is particularly useful for solving problems involving connected components, cycle detection, and more.

## Introduction to Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

Disjoint Set Union is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets. It provides two main operations:

- `Union`: Merge two sets into one by connecting their representatives.
- `Find`: Determine which set a particular element belongs to and find the representative of that set.

DSU is widely used in various algorithms and applications, such as Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, cycle detection in graphs, and more.

## Applications of Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

DSU is applied in numerous domains, including:

- Graph Algorithms: Solving problems related to connected components.
- Network Connectivity: Determining if all nodes in a network are connected.
- Maze Solving: Finding a path through a maze with walls.
- Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into distinct regions.

## Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Operations

DSU typically provides two main operations:

### Union

The `Union` operation merges two sets into one by connecting their representatives. It ensures that elements from both sets are now considered part of a single set.

### Find

The `Find` operation determines which set a particular element belongs to and finds the representative of that set. It is used to check if two elements are in the same set and to find the root representative of a set.
