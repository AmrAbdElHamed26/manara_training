This template contains a simple implementation of a singly linked list . Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science for managing collections of data.



## Features

- **Singly Linked List**: This implementation is based on a singly linked list, where each element in the list is represented by a node that contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

- **Basic Operations**: The linked list supports basic operations such as insertion at and end of the list, removal of elements , search for the element , and traversal for display.

- **Reversing the List**: The Template  also includes a function to reverse the linked list, allowing you to reverse the order of elements in the list.
