# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This is a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. A BST is a hierarchical data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements.

## Introduction

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child. The BST follows the property that for each node:

- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

This property ensures that elements in the BST are efficiently organized, making it useful for tasks such as searching, sorting, and more.

## Features

- Insertion: Add elements to the BST while maintaining the BST property.
- Search: Check if a specific value exists in the BST.
- Traversal: Perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the BST.
