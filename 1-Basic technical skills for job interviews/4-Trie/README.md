# Trie Data Structure for String Searching

This Template contains an implementation of a Trie data structure, which is designed for efficient string searching. Tries are particularly useful when you need to perform operations like searching for words, prefix matching, and auto-completion.

## Overview

A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. It is optimized for tasks like string matching, prefix matching, and auto-completion.

In this implementation, each node in the Trie represents a character, and the path from the root node to a leaf node forms a string. The Trie allows for efficient insertion, searching, and auto-completion operations.

## Usage

### Insertion

You can insert a string into the Trie using the `insert` method. Here's how the insertion did :

### autocomplete
find all strings that start with the same prefix
