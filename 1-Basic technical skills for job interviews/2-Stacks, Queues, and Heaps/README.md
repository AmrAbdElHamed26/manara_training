# Stacks And Queues

## 1- Stacks

- Video that explains basic stack operations: [Watch Video](https://github.com/AmrAbdElHamed26/movie_app/assets/86882938/6e86dede-2793-46de-9633-8fa93dabebe8)

This template contains a simple implementation of a Stack.

### Features

- **Stack Data Structure**: This implementation is based on a stack, a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are pushed onto and popped off the top of the stack.

- **Basic Operations**: The stack supports essential operations such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements off the stack, checking if the stack is empty, accessing the top element, and displaying the contents of the stack.

These features describe the capabilities and functionalities of the stack implementation.

This template contains a simple implementation of a Queue.

### Features

- **Queue Data Structure**: This implementation is based on a queue, a fundamental data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front of the queue.

- **Basic Operations**: The queue supports essential operations such as enqueueing elements at the rear of the queue, dequeuing elements from the front of the queue, checking if the queue is empty, accessing the front element, and displaying the contents of the queue.

These features describe the capabilities and functionalities of the queue implementation.
