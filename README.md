# Manara Training: How to Land a Job at a Global Tech Company

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, where I document my journey of learning and growth in the fields of data structures, algorithms, and behavioral skills with [Manara](https://old.manara.tech/about-us) . This repository serves as a reflection of my progress and the knowledge I've gained throughout my learning experience.

## About My Learning Journey at Manara Training

In my personal learning journey at Manara Training, I am dedicated to acquiring the skills and knowledge required to excel in interviews and secure positions at top tech companies worldwide. My approach includes extensive learning of valuable data structures and algorithms, hands-on implementation, and rigorous problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. I've also engaged in over 50 peer-to-peer interviews to discuss these problems and techniques.

My journey encompasses:

- **Technical Skills**: I am deeply committed to comprehensive training across various technical concepts, with a particular focus on data structures and algorithms.

- **Behavioral Skills**: In addition to technical expertise, I understand the significance of cultivating strong behavioral skills to become a well-rounded candidate.

This repository serves as a documentation of my dedicated efforts, ongoing progress, and the knowledge I've acquired while pursuing these objectives. It is a personal space where I reflect on my path towards becoming a formidable contender in the tech industry.

### 3-Advanced LeetCode Problem Solving

I completed the "Advanced LeetCode Problem Solving" course, solving over 100 challenging problems that required advanced techniques in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/amr2652001/). These problems pushed my technical and analytical skills to the limit, preparing me for real-world problem-solving scenarios encountered in tech interviews. This accomplishment reflects my dedication to becoming a top-tier candidate in the tech industry, and I continue to apply these skills in my journey.
